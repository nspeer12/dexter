            <h2>Gestures and You</h2>
            <p>
                Hands-free communication with computers has long been a science fiction dream. But with budding technology 
                      and innovative drive, gesture based commands are no longer a thing of the future, but the present. Gestures are 
                      a nonverbal way to manipulate your desktop to work for you when your hands are otherwise tied. They are a core part of Dexter's 
                      framework and something we wanted to be completely unique to each user. 
                Gestures are recorded via webcam, where hand-tracking technology memorizes the user's hand motions and transforms
                      them into readable, useable commands capable of doing anything a mouse and keyboard could do.
