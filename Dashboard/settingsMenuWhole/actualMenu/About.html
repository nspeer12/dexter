              The main motivation behind this project is to take multiple forms of Artificial Intelligence and combine them into one cohesive system. More often than not, AI products and systems are single faceted. Typically, in AI courses and research, only one narrow aspect of AI is considered. Now, think about us Humans; we use multiple forms of our natural intelligence to go about our lives. We use our vision to see what’s around us. Language to communicate ideas and information. Listening to understand others and our environment. Motor skills to walk, drive, and play video games. And high-level cognition to tie it all together. In this project, I want to take the multiple forms of AI and orchestrate them into one intelligent system. 
What motivates me about this project is that this idea allows me to use technical skills to implement the AI, but also creative skills to give it some life. I want to create something that is exciting, interesting, and fun for users. I want to take the current state-of-the-art AI technology and apply it to make something practical and useful. What we are creating is going to be alive. It is going to have energy and a personality. It is going to be funny and interesting. We are going to make computers more human, and that’s exciting to me.
Of course, the Iron Man movies are a huge inspiration to me. Tony Stark is a character that inspires me to be creative with technology, and to do it for the benefit of other people, while looking cool at the same time. He has a love for technology and creation, builds technology that he finds interesting and useful, and uses it to do good in the world. Tony relies on J.A.R.V.I.S. to get things done. Although I doubt we’ll create something as good as J.A.R.V.I.S., mainly because the technology isn’t quite there yet, I think it is worth a shot.

            This project is really interesting because it could potentially revolutionize the way that people interact with their computer. I was inspired by Tony Stark from the movie Iron Man and the way he interacted with his computer. He often spoke to his virtual assistant AI named J.A.R.V.I.S., I also remember the way he used his hand and fingers for gesture controls, without any need for a mouse or keyboard.  After seeing how the interaction just flows, I wanted to recreate the experience as closely as possible. 
I also like this project a lot because my interest is artificial intelligence and I personally feel like a majority of this system is going to be created using that. It could use technology such as OpenCV for hand/finger gesture controls, as well as natural language processing. All this will let me combine my skill set to deliver a product that would be really useful. 
I also felt like this project is really important because it is software that can be distributed worldwide. Anyone can download this software and run it on their computer, instead of it being inside software only being used by a few people. I want people to feel like they can stand up and walk around while interacting with their computer instead of sitting down all day, typing and moving their mouse.

            <p>This project is really exciting for me personally because it gives me the opportunity to work with a great team to build an application that I can use in my day-to-day life. My grand vision for this project is a voice and gesture controlled assistant with a focus on scalability such that features can be added by an end user to whatever suits their needs. This could allow for anyone to create libraries of commands that could be hosted in a centralized repository and shared on a website. One thing I would like to see in our voice assistant that would separate it from its counterparts is a more intelligent, proactive approach to where it can provide suggestions such as monitor for high CPU usage and give alerts when a certain program is slowing down your system.
              Aside from the personal utility aspect, one thing I would like to focus on for this project would be the design aspect. For the majority of my software design projects, I have always prioritized functionality over a sleek and well-designed front end. In honor of the inspiration for this project, the JARVIS assistant from Iron Man, I would like to take this project as an opportunity to gain experience in designing responsive and futuristic GUI with slick animations that would look at home in an engineering design montage. 
              My last goal for this project is to learn about computer vision and possibly neural networks depending on what implementation route we go with gesture recognition. The computer vision route would be if we decide to go with a webcam-based gesture recognition algorithm, I do foresee possible complications if we do go this route however, such as the accuracy of these recognition algorithms if we try to go with user customizable gestures which I would like to achieve. There are other technologies we can use out there, such as a consumer available hand recognition camera, with included software and an API which provides real time, highly accurate hand tracking data. Part of the fun will be experimenting with these different technologies and finding out what works well and what doesn't.

              <p>Watching Iron Man movies as an impressionable kid set me on the path to become a Computer Scientist. I was inspired by the combined power of AI and humans portrayed on screen and in comic books, and it evolved into a passion the further into my degree I progressed. To finish with this homage to J.A.R.V.I.S, the very idea that provoked purpose in me, was an unmissable opportunity that I’m beyond excited to take. The interactions between J.A.R.V.I.S and Tony Stark opened my eyes to the links between humans and their computers and the powerful possibilities when they are combined. 
                My motivation in this project stems from the possibilities of AI-Human interaction. Artificial Intelligence is more than a computer. It is a powerful system capable of supporting its users in any task, uncompromising and never tiring. It is something as limitless as the human imagination and being able to explore it in its relative infancy is a privilege. I’m excited to work with an inspired, organized team passionate about the creation of a new, personalized experience between user and computer.

                <p>To begin with, my goal is to become a game developer. And new methods of human-computer interaction mean new ways to play games. I’m also interested in future technologies, which is why I went into computer science. I’ve always been fond of the sci-fi genre and wondered how long it would take for reality to catch up.
                  Although ‘catching up’ is subjective… to be honest, compared to those computers in fiction which always seem to be messing up, computers in real life never make any mistakes (at least, on their own initiative). But it’s those very mistakes that make computers seem alive…for example, in gaming, computers are programmed to make intentional mistakes. In games like chess, it can even be hard to tell if you’re playing with a human or not.
                  Disabled people can also benefit from a smarter computer. For example, someone with problems in their ‘hand bones’ (like me) that are forced to always type on a computer instead of writing could certainly appreciate an even more convenient way to input words.
                  This project won’t create a sentient AI, but if it can become just as useful as a mouse or keyboard, we’ll be making something pretty impressive. Most importantly, I think it’ll be pretty fun.
